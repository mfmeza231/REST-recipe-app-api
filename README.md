# REST-recipe-app-api

This is the source code for a project I've done to build a backend REST API using Python, Django, Django REST Framework, Docker, Travis CI, Postgres and Test Driven Development!


## The REST API can handle:

- User authentication

- Creating objects

- Filtering and sorting objects

- Uploading and viewing images

## Additionally, the following was also done with this project:

- Setup a project with Docker and Docker-Compose

- Configure Travis-CI to automatically run linting and unit tests

- Write unit tests using the Django Test Framework

- Apply best practice principles including Test Driven Development  

- Handle uploading media files with Django

- Customize the Django admin

- Configure a Postgres database
